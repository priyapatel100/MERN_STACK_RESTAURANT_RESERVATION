              Welcome to The Bison
              Our Story

              Nestled in the heart of Rajkot, The Bison is the culmination of a lifelong dream and a shared passion for exceptional dining. Established in 1995, our journey began with a simple desireâ€”to create a haven where flavors dance, and every meal is a celebration.
              The Culinary Tapestry

              At The Bison, we view food as an art form. Our culinary artisans, under the guidance of Executive Chef john mark, embark on a daily quest for perfection. Each dish is a canvas, and every ingredient is a stroke of inspiration, resulting in a menu that tells a story of creativity and innovation.
